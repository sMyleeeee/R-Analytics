 even before the show was recorded, but because the most beloved nature voice (
David Attenborough) said it, nobody questioned anything.Finally what really bug
s me is why IMDb decided to put it in first place with only 70 000 votes and no
t even with as few as that can it sustain a REAL average of 9.0. It makes no se

g it.I have been watching nature documentaries for many years. Everyone of them
 has been a depiction of beauty of nature and the planet we are living in.With 
all the bloodshed and cruelty that is unfolding all around, committed by US hum
an beings, it is a relief to the heart, so soothing to the mind and calming to 
the eye to see such an enthralling master piece. The mesmerizing scenes of bird
s, soaring in the blue sky, their sleek feathers glimmering in the sun, the cap
tivating green of leaves trembling in wake of monkeys jumping over them, the en
chanting scene of Nubian Ibex baby deftly climbing down the cliff, dodging the

 the grandeur of mountains superimposed by the stars in the time lapse, specks 
of ice swaying down in the winter scene and all enrapturing beauties of nature 
playing out right in front of our eyes, it is all a reminder of how majestic th
is world is.The trance is culminated by the legendary voice of the gem, Sir. Da

y and all the majesty of these creatures invokes a feeling in the viewers mind

stically intertwined, connected and linked. I also bow in respect to the crew i

[]\TU/lmtt/m/n/10 ## [17] "Absolutely adore the first []Planet Earth[] from 200
7, one of the best documentaries ever made and actually is more than that. Davi
d Attenborough (brother of director/actor Richard) is wisely considered a natio
nal treasure for very good reason, no matter how much he himself dislikes the t
erm.So hearing that there was a second series nearly a decade later, there was 
absolutely no doubt as to whether to watch it. []Planet Earth II[] is as good a
s others have said and there is not much to add, it is along with its predecess
or one of the best documentaries personally seen and most of the time it actual
ly feels much more than that. Throughout it[]s an awe-inspiring, utterly transf
ixing experience where one forgets they[]re watching a documentary and instead 
feeling like they[]re watching art. This may sound like extreme hyperbole, but 
to me and many others []Planet Earth II[] is completely deserving of its praise
 and even deserving of more. To me as well, it is easily one of the best the BB
C has done in years.[]Planet Earth II[] for starters looks amazing. It is gorge
ously filmed, done in a completely fluid and natural, sometimes intimate (a gre
at way of connecting even more with the animals), way and never looking static.
 In fact much of it is remarkably cinematic. The scenery and habitats are some 
of the most breath-taking personally seen anywhere, whether in visual media and
 real life, the mountains in \"Mountains\" in particular are spectacular and \"
Jungles\" captures the colour, excitement and formidable danger of the jungle b
eautifully. The rich colours just leap out. For a composer that composes normal
ly bombastic, rousing and pulse-racing music that is epic even in the quieter m
oments, Hans Zimmer[]s music here is a remarkably good fit, it[]s unmistakably 
Zimmer in style but throughout it not only complements the visuals but enhances
 them.What of the narrative aspects? Can[]t fault []Planet Earth II[] in this a
spect either. The narration has a great well-balanced mix of facts that will be
 familiar to the viewer and others that will induce the right amount of surpris
e. In short, it[]s just fascinating, informative and thoughtful. This balance w
as even achieved in the \"Cities\" episode, that may have been the one that tra
nsfixed me the least due to being more invested in the animals and their habita
ts of the previous episodes.But the episode still managed to intrigue and illum
inate, and credit has to go to []Planet Earth II[] for adhering to what made []
Planet Earth[] work the first time and then bringing a freshness with a few nic
e ideas to avoid it being too stale. Attenborough delivers it beautifully, ther
e[]s a soft-spoken enthusiasm and precision about his delivery and he never pre
aches.The animals themselves are a wonderful mix of the adorable (the penguins 
in \"Islands\") and the dangerous (the lions in \"Grasslands\" and \"Deserts\")
, and one actually finds they[]re rooting for them in exactly the same way they
 would a human character. []Planet Earth II[] contains a good deal of suspense 
(especially in \"Deserts\") and emotional impact (\"Islands\"). Even the fights
/conflicts against the animals are completely riveting, some epic moments in \"
Jungles\".It doesn[]t feel like six episodes either, and none of the episodes f
eel episodic or repetitive. []Planet Earth II[] instead feels like a collection
 of six individual stories with real, complex emotions and conflicts and animal
 characters developed in a way a human character would in a film but does it be
tter than several.Overall, utterly mesmerising. For documentary lovers or fans 
of []Planet Earth[], []Planet Earth II[] is not to be missed at all costs and h
as more than enough to entice one to watch it again and again, finding somethin
g new each time and never getting tired of it. 10/10 Bethany Cox"[]

\TU/lmtt/m/n/10 it is one of the great achievements in any area of culture from
 this or any other year. Little else shows such skill and dedication from its m
akers, or is as moving in its sense of beauty and feeling of something larger t
han ourselves. It is an emotive evocation rather than cerebral narrative, and t
o this end there is extensive and prominent use of music, and added sound effec
ts. Some find these intrusive, but for me they were very effective. There were 
a few occasions on which I felt that emphasis on getting in close went too far 
- for example the fighting Komodo dragons broke from the top of the frame unnec
essarily, and the framing of eagles fighting over a carcass felt a little tight
. However pushing the boundaries in any field can sometimes mean going too far,
 and this is surely trivial set against the scale of the achievement. Sequence 
after sequence is profoundly impressive, and the cumulative effect uniquely won
derful. This is of course worth seeing with the best quality source and the lar
gest, best quality screen you can find. The Blu-ray transfer is excellent.In re
viewing last year[]s outstanding \"The Hunt\" I wrote that I found it hard to i
magine how even the BBC wildlife unit could surpass that. Now I see. Can even t
he BBC wildlife surpass this? Maybe Planet Earth 3?"[]

7, one of the best documentaries ever made and actually is more than that. Davi
d Attenborough (brother of director/actor Richard) is wisely considered a natio
nal treasure for very good reason, no matter how much he himself dislikes the t
erm.So hearing that there was a second series nearly a decade later, there was 
absolutely no doubt as to whether to watch it. []Planet Earth II[] is as good a
s others have said and there is not much to add, it is along with its predecess
or one of the best documentaries personally seen and most of the time it actual
ly feels much more than that. Throughout it[]s an awe-inspiring, utterly transf
ixing experience where one forgets they[]re watching a documentary and instead 
feeling like they[]re watching art. This may sound like extreme hyperbole, but 
to me and many others []Planet Earth II[] is completely deserving of its praise
 and even deserving of more. To me as well, it is easily one of the best the BB
C has done in years.[]Planet Earth II[] for starters looks amazing. It is gorge
ously filmed, done in a completely fluid and natural, sometimes intimate (a gre
at way of connecting even more with the animals), way and never looking static.
 In fact much of it is remarkably cinematic. The scenery and habitats are some 
of the most breath-taking personally seen anywhere, whether in visual media and
 real life, the mountains in \"Mountains\" in particular are spectacular and \"
Jungles\" captures the colour, excitement and formidable danger of the jungle b
eautifully. The rich colours just leap out. For a composer that composes normal
ly bombastic, rousing and pulse-racing music that is epic even in the quieter m
oments, Hans Zimmer[]s music here is a remarkably good fit, it[]s unmistakably 
Zimmer in style but throughout it not only complements the visuals but enhances
 them.What of the narrative aspects? Can[]t fault []Planet Earth II[] in this a
spect either. The narration has a great well-balanced mix of facts that will be
 familiar to the viewer and others that will induce the right amount of surpris
e. In short, it[]s just fascinating, informative and thoughtful. This balance w
as even achieved in the \"Cities\" episode, that may have been the one that tra
nsfixed me the least due to being more invested in the animals and their habita
ts of the previous episodes.But the episode still managed to intrigue and illum
inate, and credit has to go to []Planet Earth II[] for adhering to what made []
Planet Earth[] work the first time and then bringing a freshness with a few nic
e ideas to avoid it being too stale. Attenborough delivers it beautifully, ther
e[]s a soft-spoken enthusiasm and precision about his delivery and he never pre
aches.The animals themselves are a wonderful mix of the adorable (the penguins 
in \"Islands\") and the dangerous (the lions in \"Grasslands\" and \"Deserts\")
, and one actually finds they[]re rooting for them in exactly the same way they
 would a human character. []Planet Earth II[] contains a good deal of suspense 
(especially in \"Deserts\") and emotional impact (\"Islands\"). Even the fights
/conflicts against the animals are completely riveting, some epic moments in \"
Jungles\".It doesn[]t feel like six episodes either, and none of the episodes f
eel episodic or repetitive. []Planet Earth II[] instead feels like a collection
 of six individual stories with real, complex emotions and conflicts and animal
 characters developed in a way a human character would in a film but does it be
tter than several.Overall, utterly mesmerising. For documentary lovers or fans 
of []Planet Earth[], []Planet Earth II[] is not to be missed at all costs and h
as more than enough to entice one to watch it again and again, finding somethin
g new each time and never getting tired of it. 10/10 Bethany Cox"[]

\TU/lmtt/m/n/10 it is one of the great achievements in any area of culture from
 this or any other year. Little else shows such skill and dedication from its m
akers, or is as moving in its sense of beauty and feeling of something larger t
han ourselves. It is an emotive evocation rather than cerebral narrative, and t
o this end there is extensive and prominent use of music, and added sound effec
ts. Some find these intrusive, but for me they were very effective. There were 
a few occasions on which I felt that emphasis on getting in close went too far 
- for example the fighting Komodo dragons broke from the top of the frame unnec
essarily, and the framing of eagles fighting over a carcass felt a little tight
. However pushing the boundaries in any field can sometimes mean going too far,
 and this is surely trivial set against the scale of the achievement. Sequence 
after sequence is profoundly impressive, and the cumulative effect uniquely won
derful. This is of course worth seeing with the best quality source and the lar

 other (Vasya, not Vasiliy, Lyuda, not Lyudmila).\nBut the most important thing
 that this film shows is that the soviet authoritiies lied to people about this
 catastrophe all the time. For example, in Kiev which is 130 km from Chernobyl,
 nobody knew about the high levels of radiation till the middle of May, they ev
en held a parade on the first of May, when the level of radiation in Kiev was 1
00 times higher than normal (iodine131 isotope) and nobody gave us the iodine p
ills. Everyone who tried to tell the truth was called the provocateur and could
 even be fired from work.\nI highly recommend to watch this film. This is a tri
bute to all the heroes who lost their lives in a radioactive flame and saved al
l of us from death."[]

he sky was clear without any sign of clouds in the spring of 1986. It was like 
any other day behind the iron curtain. Not a lot to do but not a lot to worry a
bout either, a long day of boring work after dropping the kid off at the kinder
garten, just to pick him up again at the afternoon, just like yesterday or any 
other day since the beginning of time. This is why she did not understand why t
he old lady (who she very much liked because she seemed to love children and ha
d that neverstopping smile) told everyone at the nursery school not to let the 
children out to play, don[]t feed them the veggies and don[]t let them drink th
e milk we had for every lunch before that day. We lived in a hungarian town clo
se to the croatian border and the life in that town was pretty simple apart fro
m that day. We lived 900 kms from Chernobyl and we did not even know that place
 exists until 3 days later.Apparently a man who did not introduce himself calle
d most of the schools and nurseries in the country and told them the same messa
ge. A lot of teachers did not take it seriously as he did not mention any detai
ls, just the warning: do not let the children out, do not feed them any vegetab
les which grows overground (potatoes are fine), do not let them drink anything 
apart from bottled liquids.Noone knew what it was about. Noone knew what danger
 we are in. I assume this is why it was such a shock. The life was simple and w
e were not supposed to know stuff. We were not supposed to be afraid, maybe onl
y because the capitalist pigs over the iron curtain. But something changed that
 day. A faceless, nameless man risked his life and called everyone he could to 
warn them about Chernobyl. News like this is not easy to contain, soon everyone
 was talking about what could happen and why. Is it a nuclear attack? Is it the
 CIA? Are they looking at us from satelites? Are they bombing us?It was the fir
st crack on the Iron Curtain. Not Reagan[]s stupid monologue, not the thousands
 of fleeing east-germans, not the soviets economy[]s ridiculous debts. Entire n
ations realized their lives mean nothing, millions felt betrayed. A man with no
 name defeated the Soviet regime with a few telephone calls.We still don[]t kno
w who that man was. After 30 years and a few inquiries we have no clue who risk
ed his life to prevent thousands of deaths and millions of illnesses. Some hist
orians are adamant the person was executed and vanished without a trace, some s
ay noone found him at all. All I know I have to be grateful for him. We all hav
e to be. He saved a nation. Sure, we could survive the radioactive cloud the mi
ld wind blew over our country but when I look at my two children who are the sa
me age I was back then I am pretty sure I am not willing to take any risks. Wou
ld you?Dear anonymous man who defied a violent regime to save millions: We will
 forever be grateful. Dear ukranian workers whose names we will never know: We 
will forever be grateful. The workers whose names we know: We will forever be g
rateful.This show tells a story noone should forget and this is the right way t

 to go to Ukraine, where we spent most of vocation. It should have been the sam
e in 1986, but Chernobyl happened. Official info reiterated that there is nothi

 had learned to read between the lines and my farther used his military channel
s to find out EXACTLY what kind of catastrophe was taking place. He had some in
fo from KGB guys themselves. However, he was reassured that Kiev and certain pa
rts of Ukraine was free of the nuclear fallout and the level of the radioactivi
ty was within normal urban level. He was also clearly warned where NOT TO GO un
der any circumstances: North-West of Ukraine and big part of Belarus was a heav
y fall-out zone. They also mentioned some European countries. Needless to say, 
that nobody else was talking about this on TV. We made a decision not to change
 our plans for the summer, but keep in mind those warnings.Each of us had DKP-5
0A - dosimeter that measures the exposure dose of gamma radiation. We checked t
he data afterwards and all measures were withing normal limits or less. I remem
ber though, that it was restricted to collect mushrooms or wild berries in the 
forests anywhere in Ukraine. Any dusty environment was considered dangerous. Al
l water wells were sealed with plastic etc etc\nMini series exceeded my expecta

pisodes) only minor discrepancies in the overall image of the life in the USSR.

 middle name. In the military it was different - \"comrade\" + rank (as in mode
rn Russia, BTW). I[]m looking forward to see the rest.\nI am thankful to the au

health, saving millions of lives.\nEVERYONE should watch this show and see for

[]\TU/lmtt/m/n/10 ##  [6] "I don[]t subscribe to HBO. A couple of weeks ago I h
eard an interview with a young actor from this series on NPR. It was described 
as a \"gritty crime drama\" with many Baltimore locals portraying variations on
 themselves. The interview made it sound interesting enough that I decided to c
heck out the first season on DVD.After the first few episodes I became seriousl
y hooked and devoted 36 hours of the next ten days to the show.Having now watch
ed the first 3 seasons, I believe it to be the best television series I have se
en.I do not understand why this show hasn[]t generated the buzz or the awards o
f HBO[]s other series, such as the Sopranos or Deadwood. It is more gripping, f
aster paced, and more intelligent. The other shows can be a bit plodding, with 
plot lines that go nowhere, and a few characters I don[]t much care about. That
 wasn[]t the case here.The show is a cross between the Sopranos and the old NBC
 show Homicide: Life on the Street. The crime/sopranos side and the law/Homicid
e side run in parallel. Individually, the parallel plot lines are compelling. I
n tandem, they are complimentary and brilliant.There is no way to avoid having 
\"the best show ever\" tag sound like anything but silly hype--regardless, what
 makes this show substantially better than any other realistic and compelling c
rime or police drama is the fact it is... searching. It doesn[]t just delve int
o the individual psychologies motivating these people (ala the Sopranos) or the
 complex interactions amongst the members of a community (ala Deadwood) it asks
 \"what the hell can be done for all of these people\" and points out the probl
ems with any and all of the answers.It[]s truly brilliant. If you like intellig
ent television, I envy the enjoyment you will have watching this for the first 
time."[]

 it was boring the first time, they bother with details normally other TV shows

 so much. Sure, the cast, direction, camera and writing are outstanding; defini
tely some of the best on TV, but I found the story to be lacking the entertainm
ent value. I found the praised realism of the show to be too... real, to really
 be enjoyable. For a person who was in the army or police or had dealings with 
other uniformed organizations, the show just reaffirms what they already know. 
State organizations are indeed mostly governed by people doing each other favor
s, protecting their asses and doing as little of what is required as possible, 
while appearing to be doing their job. To a person who has little contact with 
uniformed organizations, the workings of the police department portrayed in The
 Wire seem realistic but unbelievable. While the acquainted person probably yea
rns to see another way to do things, the unacquainted hopes for the despicable 
vision to be finally dispelled. Not only does this not happen, but the last sea
son shows that even people with the best intentions get corrupted and broken an
d the only way to manage to do something right is to lie and cheat while at it.

 I can tell them: \"see The Wire, it shows that perfectly\"."[]

[]\TU/lmtt/m/n/10 ## [15] "I say that without a shred of hyperbole. The Wire[]s
 importance, beyond setting the standard for all modern television, is one of a
 historical document. 500 years from now, the show will surely be one of a hand
ful that allows future generations to glean the state of American society durin
g this time period -- it[]s problems, it[]s people, it[]s language, it[]s insti
tutions, and the constant tension that exists when all of these are forced to c
oexist.This is due to the fact that the Wire, through nuance and true-to- life 
portrayal of human interactions, constructs an extremely lucid and heart-breaki
ng evaluation of almost every aspect of society. Most of you reading right now 
wake up every day as a cog in the massive, interwoven, and fundamentally autono
mous institutions which together make up a capitalist society. However, given t
hat we are all a minuscule part of this larger whole, it is nary impossible to 
take a step back and objectively evaluate just how much influence these institu
tions hold over the course of our lives. It[]s not unlike trying summarize a 10
00-page novel while holding a single random page less than an inch from your fa
ce. Our perspectives are inherently limited in this regard, and so too is any v
ain attempt to connect the pieces and make sense of it all.This point is one of
 the many reasons that the Wire warrants our time and careful consideration. Fr
om a bird[]s-eye perspective, each season builds on those prior until at the ve
ry end we have no choice but to reckon with vast tapestry of individual strands
 as a singular work. One that feels so true to life that it[]s near impossible 
for me to think of anything else, fiction or non-fiction, book or movie, painti
ng or play, sculpture or architectural feat, which in their combined power hold
s the volume of educational lessons, thoughtfulness, humanism, pure ethos, or e
ntertainment that the Wire does.\"All the pieces matter,\" a quote that flashes
 across the screen at the beginning of an episode in Season One, is prophetic i
n it[]s understanding that the totality of something can have a much greater im
pact than its individual parts. And that is why I find it upsetting when readin
g reviewers which call the show \"boring\" or \"slowly paced\" or \"overrated\"
 and then go on to admit that they gave up watching before the end of Season Tw
o. I am not a cynic by nature and in general tend to dismiss the common critici
sm that our generation is one that needs constant gratification all of the time
 in order to stay engaged with something for the long haul. But in this case, I
 truly believe that the Wire is so much different than what most people are use
d to watching on the medium of television that some may get confused or frustra
ted when the show refuses to pander to the standard beats and thrill-inducing p
lot devices on an episode-by-episode basis which we have been trained to expect
 with TV shows. There are no neatly wrapped episode arcs, no spoon-feeding over
 obvious plot points via voice-overs or flashbacks, and no musical score to tel
l us how a particular scene or moment should make us feel.Instead, the show for
ces us to become witnesses to a series of events in much the same way we would 
witness something unfolding right in front of us. Especially during Season One,
 David Simon and his creative team give us a lot of footage that looks like it 
should be from a documentary. This is all intentional, of course. The 4:3 film,
 the non-HD look, the way the camera seems to lack the traditional god- like po
wer to always know that a character is going to say something important so that
 it shows us that character a second or two before they say their line (indeed,
 if you watch closely you[]ll notice that there are times that the camera will 
only pan to a speaking character after they begin saying their lines, giving th
e viewer the distinct feeling of a real-life situation unfolding in real time) 
-- all of these things are by careful design. And all of these devices add to t
he show[]s power because the characters become more real when depicted in this 
way. This makes it all the more devastating every time one of these characters 
is chewed up and spit out by the merciless wheels of capitalistic institutions 
surrounding them. I chose to write a review which differs from many of the othe
rs here because simply rehashing why I love Omar so much, or which season is th
e best, or why I think it[]s better/worse than the Sopranos or Breaking Bad are
 all things which are touched upon over and over again. Instead I wanted to pro
vide my own analysis about why the show succeeds and stands apart of from other
s to the point where comparison is futile. Some people, including myself, think
 that the show will provide you with such an empathy-rich experience that when 
you have finished you may potentially see the world a little bit differently, t
hat you[]ll feel a little bit closer to all of the people you share this countr
y with, no matter how different their persona or background is from your own. B
y this measure, your persistence and patience given to the show will be repaid 
10-fold."[]

his was a massive step forward.Of course, this isn[]t the first form of media t

 it here is remarkable. For every element to be adopted into its own nation, re
flecting the psyches and philosophies attributed to the respective element is t

, and you can[]t help but to really love these characters and their pets. But t
his is just the beginning of the glue that keeps you coming back. Great plots a
nd stunning visuals are just as much of importance to the overall success of th
e show. The story lines are top notch, being both episodic in nature and chrono
logically integral from one show to the next. Each episode usually introduces a
 new and genuinely interesting opposition and/or characters to be overcome by t
he end of the show, and visually there is plenty of awe inspiring backgrounds a
nd quality animation. With just enough well paced action, some sincere points o
f moral conviction (can you believe it), and witty humor makes the show a winni
ng combination. This is entertainment for all ages, and definitely a must see."

[]\TU/lmtt/m/n/10 ##  [6] "This review will be very long. I adore this show wit
h every fibre of my being, and view it to be a piece of animated perfection. I 
implore people to avoid the disgusting live-action adaptation by director M. Ni
ght Shyamalan, as it is a disrespectful sham that mocks everything that the sho
w stood for and mastered.So as for the show itself, where to begin? Well let[]s
 start with the story overall. Avatar tells a complete a perfectly paced epic p
lot over the course of 61 22 minute episodes. The show contains several unique 
and beautifully detailed characters among its main cast, all of whom are given 
consistent and engaging development throughout. From family related guilt and a
ngst, identity dilemmas and the characters constant, overarching and looming qu
est, the characters are pressed with many trials which actually truly change th
em over the course of their magnificent journey. Aside from the primary cast, m
any intriguing and varied side characters appear throughout the adventure. They
 offer comedic levity, new forms of drama and help to add to the deep mythologi
cal and philosophical backbone of the show. All characters are exquisitely writ
ten and voice acted, with not a badly portrayed among them. Next I will cover t
he show[]s borderline legendary animation. It is a sight to behold indeed. I be
lieve I am justified in believing that such stellar production values will neve
r again be pared with this level of artistic imagination again, at least not in
 my lifetime. The scope, creativity and energy of the shows animation is second
 to no other show, and it[]s balance of colour is never anything less than subl
ime. Aside from sweeping and moving visuals, Avatar also offers fast paced and 
unbelievably well choreographed action scenes (once again, second to none) and 
well timed slapstick comedy. Not only is the animation stunning, it is also sta
ggeringly versatile. The show[]s epic mythos is also very strong, and demands t
o be deepened and added to (thankfully Korra is doing just that). It takes insp
iration from Buddhist, Inuit, Western, Japanese and Korean cultures to deliver 
it[]s unique world, as well as many original and creative elements in conjuncti
on with the more recognisable real world concepts. The show manages to weave ph
ilosophy and deep moral concepts within its world and characters, creating one 
of the most fleshed out fantasy worlds of the last several decades. In conclusi
on, what can I even say? I love Avatar: TLA more every time I experience it, an
d it is one of very few shows (or even films) which can provoke a primal emotio
nal response from me each time I see it, without fail. It sends shivers down my
 spine, and puts a tear to my eye, leaving me totally satisfied and fulfilled e
ach time. My favourite television show, of all time."[]

pisodes, but overall I can easily say this is one of the best anime I[]ve ever 
seen. Most memorable too. The protagonists were very relatable and easy to root
 for. Although the show tried to convince us that \"the Avatar team members\" w
ere just kids, they all looked and acted at least a few years older, especially
 Aang (he really doesn[]t sell a 12-year-old kid, especially in season 2 and 3)
. But that[]s a good thing. I liked it better for it. Prince Zuko is another gr
eat example. He was supposed to be around 16, but seemed more like 18, if not e
ven 19. Again, I preferred it this way.Characters[] archers were done splendidl
y. Especially Zuko[]s. His journey was by far the most transforming and I liked
 how he struggled to choose between good and evil. Aang[]s crush on Katara was 
cute at first, and I thought nothing of it, but then it has developed into some
thing more, even if it did take a long time for it. Their love was definitely s
omething to root for.And last but not least, Sokka and Toph. Both were absolute
ly amazing. One a warrior with a fun side, always saying something funny, but a
lso really looking out for his sister and other friends, and the other a blind 
girl with unimaginable power. Even animal companions had their own characters. 
Loved it. And the finale! It was amazing. One of the best ones in the history o
f TV shows. \"Avatar\" really built up to it. Just go see it. I couldn[]t recom
mend more.PS: If you haven[]t watched yet \"The Legend of Korra\", which is sup
posed to be Avatar[]s sequel, please don[]t. It destroys everything \"The Last 
Airbender\" holds dear. You[]ll just end up depressed. instead, pretend it does
n[]t exist. Trust me, it[]s better this way."[]

[]\TU/lmtt/m/n/10 ##  [8] "Avatar The Last Airbender shouldn[]t be underestimat
ed. For a while I didn[]t even look twice at it due to it being on Nickelodeon 
and me being past the age of watching anything on Nick aside from the classic N
icktoons or Nick shows from the 1990s. But word got around that it was really f
antastic, a sort of Kung fu style show where a master goes from place to place 
having adventures. Turns out the people I heard the word from weren[]t kidding:
 the saga of Aang, the last airbender and Avatar, who masters the four elements
 (air, earth, water, fire) and has to save the world by stopping the power-hung
ry fire lord, Ozai, is as epic as anything I[]ve ever seen. It[]s an achievemen
t of storytelling that creeps up on you, and while the first season isn[]t perf
ect the second season delivers episode after episode that enriches the characte
rs and makes us care about them as we would in, for obvious example, Star Wars.
In fact, the only minor complaint I would have against the second season (not s
ure yet about the third) is that it borrows quite heavily from the Empire Stike
s Back (i.e. the []one-who-will-save-us-all[] mythology from Joseph Campbell is
 off training with an old master, feels his friend(s) in pain and danger in the
 future, rushes off before finishing training, bad things ensue, etc). But real
ly, all of the characters get developed quite well, and if anything the develop
ment of the character Prince Zuko, a scarred son of Ozai who has been banished 
until he can bring back the Avatar along with his banished uncle Iroh, is aston
ishing in its complexity. We don[]t care about this character at first, in the 
first season he comes off like a whiner with Iroh as the wonderful comic relief
 (think Pokemon if the brother and sister weren[]t so annoying). But by season 
two a whole other dimension comes into play: who are you, and what are you doin
g with yourself? The trek with the three main characters, and the extra charact
ers like Toph (a little blind girl who is one of those great bad-asses you have
 to see to believe), is one that is sophisticated enough to bring in adults, an
d for kids it[]s often just rollicking fun when it isn[]t deep or dark. The vil
lains are convincing and scary, the humor hits when it needs to (and sometimes 
it can be just downright trippy and hilarious, like the second episode of seaso
n two, the Cave of Two Lovers), and the animation is often breathtaking. As the
y say on the internet now: it[]s made of Win!"[]

three, and introduces an awesome new character, Toph, and a perfect new villain

ber of adults recommending this to other adults, as if it weren[]t a children[]
s show.I gave it an honest effort. I got most of the way through the first seas
on, very nearly to the end, because multiple people had told me it gets SO GOOD
. But really, it[]s a children[]s show. It may get good for a children[]s show,
 but as an adult it has virtually no appeal. The protagonists are annoying chil
dren, who do the same annoying crap every episode. The antagonist is an annoyin
g child, who does the same annoying crap every episode. Mako is an absolute del
ight as the uncle, but that[]s like saying the ocean was wet. Mako is ALWAYS a 
win. He is a goddamned national treasure. Mako aside though (and I am starting 
to feel like a broken record), it is a children[]s show. There is absolutely no
thing in this for adults, unless it is the nostalgia for young adults who watch
ed this and fell in love with it WHEN THEY WERE CHILDREN.So if you watched this
 as a child and loved it, apparently it really holds up and you[]ll probably lo
ve it again. If you[]re a child, for god[]s sake stop reading this review and g
o watch it. I[]m sure it[]s fantastic. However, if you[]re an adult being told
