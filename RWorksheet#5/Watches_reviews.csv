"1","watch","Casio Illuminator AE1500WH Series","Dru Ha","Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2023","","I have used my cell phone instead of a watch since about 2001.  Decided to start wearing cheap, quartz watches again because I often find myself without my cell phone within reach at rehearsals, recording sessions, lawn-mowing, or work from home situations. Picked up a few Timexes and Casios around the same time. So far, I like this model the best for general use. The size of the time display is so easy to read that I have already started preferring it to comparable analog models.  I will mostly be looking to buy digital watches like this with big, simple displays from now on.I’m not James Bond, in spite of what you may have heard. I don’t want an expensive watch on my wrist that might make me a potential target for theft/robbery downtown or on a subway. If I get some paint on this one or it breaks while I’m trying to remove an oil filter, it would be no great loss.Use is fairly intuitive and it hasn’t lost or gained time in the few weeks I’ve owned it, unlike a Timex expedition analog model I got at the same time. After only a couple of weeks, the analog Timex expedition has lost about ten seconds already, which I admit I was surprised by.The only complaint I could possibly make about this watch is that the two LED’s are quite poor in comparison to Timex’s indiglo or the backlight used on much more expensive G-Shock models. But for how cheap and functional this model is, that is a completely unfair comparison. The lights work perfectly fine for me to see if I wake up in the middle of the night but can’t roll/reach over to check my phone due to a sleeping dog contorting my legs at the foot of the bed. Or if I fall asleep on the couch.I have mostly avoided getting it wet up until now, but I did accidentally leave it in the bathroom with the shower running a couple of times and no condensation formed on the inside of the face at all even though there was plenty of water vapor in the room. I also leave it on when washing my hands with no ill-effects.I’m very impressed by how simple and functional this watch is. These cheap, digitals are light years ahead of the Timex Ironman I owned as a kid. But it should be said- that $25-$35 Ironman I bought sometime around 1995 went body boarding, surfing, in the pool with me, and I showered with it on. That thing was basically water-PROOF and never had an issue in water less than 20ft. deep. I swam in Atlantic/East-Coast hurricanes with that thing and it even got tossed around in the salty surf with me. Also used it to time lap-swimming in Olympic-sized pools. I do not have the same confidence in this model, though I have no real rationale for that.The rubber strap was very uncomfortable on the old Ironman models and used to cause some really annoying, visible, skin irritation. I found G-shock straps of that era to be almost just as bad. That is not the case with these modern Casio polymer straps.I also despise those weird circles Casio, Armitron, etc. put on watch faces and take up a quarter of the face of the watch. This watch has NONE of that BS going on. The info on the watch face is SO bold and easy to read that I would definitely prefer it to all the G-shocks with those damned, senseless circles taking up so much of the display. PV cells excluded because they actually do serve a purpose. But here’s my view on all that: if the watch battery lasts even close to ten years, it will already outlast the battery/operation of the solar-powered, $150 G-Shock I once owned by a factor of YEARS. So I would still prefer this because legibility is far more important to me than photovoltaics.After a few weeks getting used to wearing a watch again for the first time in twenty years, I’ve really appreciated not having to dig my cell phone out of my pocket just to check the time/date. A weirdly subtle difference I would never have thought would matter.  But it does. I’m starting to really like Casios!I also like the hourly chime because otherwise I get lost and completely lose track of time while recording/producing. That could only backfire if the chime goes off in the vocal booth and ruins a take. Hasn’t happened yet, though.I’m also glad they make it in the desert-sand/beige color because I’m fair skinned so it doesn’t look like a giant thing on my wrist.At some point or other I will wake up exhausted and forget to take it off before I get in the shower. At that point I will update this review if water penetrates the buttons/gaskets/seals.Again, I am in disbelief at how excellent this watch is for the price. I hope they never discontinue this model until an identical “20 Year Battery” model is available.  But by then we’ll no doubt have flying cars, rocket-skates, jet packs, and digital, tattooed watches with veinous, indiglo epidermis.  Or more than the current, standard-issue, two to three computer chips implanted into in our visual cortex at birth.Just pick the color you like and buy the damned thing!",5,NA

Big numbers. Looks like a G-Shock. If you want a watch to tell time, provide an alarm and use as a timer/stopwatch that’s easy to see, buy it. The light works fine. I have the grey with the negative display, and it’s easy to read too. Also have the tan. I wish the black and tan were available in negative display but they still look good the way they come. Great watch..great price..great battery life. Pick a color and buy it.",5,NA

I have an Apple Watch and another stainless steel “dress” watch.I wanted a watch I could wear when working out, or doing something physical that wasn’t going to buzz at me every 8 seconds and tell me what a good boy I was for taking 5 steps and remind me to breathe.Also, I think Apple Watches are great, but they’re a little bloated with useless features that, at the end of the day, I’ve never really used.I wanted something simple, easy to read, and able to take a beating. I wanted basic tactical features (like dual time zones, stop watch, alarms, timer, a clear second display, a light)This watch is easily comparable to the “G-Shock”.Not only does it do everything I want it to do, it looks incredible. It’s very stylish. Very clear, easy to read display at a glance and it fits great (I’m a guy, 5’7” with a small wrist circumference and got the “standard” size)I’ve tested the display light in the dark and it works great. Easily readable.Build quality seems excellent. Seems to be sturdy and durable. Doesn’t feel or look cheap by any means.Haven’t tested the water resistance yet but I don’t doubt it’s going to be fine.And finally, the price. The price is unbelievable for what you get. For the $20-25 price point you get way more features and value than you’d expect.Highly recommend!",5,NA

I like it, very basic. Very nice for the money I paid, good value. It seems scratch resistant and durable, and the time is pretty accurate too.One con: it did take some YouTube videos to make the alarms stop (I bought a used one and it came with alarms). But over very nice, basic, I’m glad I bought it. Also, I like the backlight. It’s the first watch I got with this kind of backlight. It’s easy to use the timer, stopwatch, and whatever. It comes with alarms, and even a time setting for a different time zone! That’s new, I never had a watch like that. Overall, I like it",4,NA
"7","watch","Casio Illuminator AE1500WH Series","JRC","Reviewed in Canada on November 13, 2024","","This is a great digital watch with a very large and easy to read display.It’s a Casio, so you know that it’s rugged and reliable.In fact, it keeps better time than watches costing thousands of dollars.The watch isn’t big on features but I really only need it for telling time .It has an outstanding price too and since it’s a Casio I expect that it will provide many years of excellent service.I have several at her Casio watches including expensive G-Shock models.The G’s are cool and they look great but I really don’t need all of their features.Also, those big watches  can be heavy and cumbersome on your wrist.Plus, this is the easiest to read Casio I have ever seen.If I could only have a single Casio watch, this is the one I’d pick.Highly, highly recommended .",5,NA

"15","watch","Casio MQ24 Series","A. J. Safian","Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2016","","I read a lot of reviews for this watch before buying it. In fact I purchased this over the other casio watch Casio Men's MQ24-1E Black Resin Watch because those reviewers complained about the watch having too small of a face and band. Well, this watch I found has the same issue for me. I am an average guy; 5'8"", 190lbs, do a lot of physical work but not buff. I do not have ""cankles"" for wrists (or would you call them ""wrankles""?). Anyway, point is, just an average male. I bought this watch because honestly, ""watch stink"" from keeping my watch on my wrist 24/7 literally ruined my favorite watch (no replacement bands available for the unique design of the watch face). I had to go through two of these expensive watches to learn what the heck ""watch stink"" even was. But I was not going to throw down a lot of money on yet another of these watches. However being watchless was driving me absolutely crazy! My watch was more important that even having my iPhone on me! So I just caved in and ordered this guy. It was a couple bucks cheaper than the casio black analogue sister watch (link above). I love/hate this watch.In short I do not like this watch for the following reasons: the watch face is slightly small (just a tad), the band is not long enough and is veryyy thin. But I KNEW this before purchasing - I'm only saying it again for emphasize to guys out there. I also do not like paper thin watch bands. I like that thick rubber or nylon feeling. The thin resin strap is cost-effective and does its job, but it's so thin and flimsy I am always tempted to rip it off my wrist at least once a day. The length of the strap is not very long either. So the buckle ends up being almost on the side of my wrist instead of under it, like it should be. I'm at the 3rd/4th to last hole. The watch in person does not look professional.But the resin strap is really the only thing that reallllly bugs me. Aside from that I appreciate that Casio made this watch practical and useful despite its price. There are a lot of junk watches out there at the same price range. These watches will have their finishes peel off, scratch easily and will not be water resistant. They will perform as cheaply as they are made. This watch surprisingly differs in that regard. It's accurate with time, simple simple simple (love that part). And is water resistant up to 50M (just make sure the screw dial pin is pushed all the way in!). The watch face is simple, sleek, and easy to read. No funky numbers, small numbers or other distractions on the face. As much as I want to call this the perfect ""beater watch,"" when I think of beater watch I think of something that's extremely durable under abuse and will last- not so much the other line of thought ""I'll just toss it if it breaks and not cry over spilt milk."" I don't like throwing things away or using things that are prone to being disposed of early on. So while I want to use this watch for my dirty tasks like work around the house, while working on my car, working with animals, etc. I do not get the feeling that this watch will stand to much abuse. I will test it out though and confirm in an update when/if this watch breaks.If there was a $20 version of this watch - one that had a longer, thicker strap, slightly bigger watch face, and the inclusion of a small date window - I would buy it in a heartbeat! For about $8 though, if you are skinny/have really narrow wrists this is perfect! Also want to mention this is not a gender-specific watch. It's truly universal. Just because it fits on narrow wrists, don't let that fool you. Both guys and gals have thin and thick wrists. This watch is ideal for the narrow-wristed folks out there. Enjoy!",5,NA
"16","watch","Casio MQ24 Series","Eduardo Cuello Suazo","Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2023","","I recently bought the Casio Men's MQ24-7B2 Analog Watch with a Black Resin Band and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations. This timepiece beautifully combines simplicity with reliability.The design is classic and minimalistic, perfect for everyday wear or even for a more formal setting. The black resin band is comfortable on the wrist and feels durable enough for daily use. The analog display is clear and easy to read, making time-telling effortless.What really stands out about this watch is its reliability. Casio is known for crafting timepieces that last, and this watch is no exception. It has been keeping accurate time since the moment I started wearing it, which is crucial for me in a watch.Moreover, its water-resistant feature has proven handy in various situations, giving me peace of mind during unexpected weather changes or accidental splashes.For its affordable price, the quality and functionality of this Casio watch are outstanding. It's a fantastic value for the money and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.If you're in search of a no-nonsense, dependable watch that won't break the bank, I highly recommend considering the Casio Men's MQ24-7B2 Analog Watch. It's a reliable companion that gets the job done while adding a touch of understated style to any outfit. Overall, a very satisfying purchase that I would gladly recommend to others.",5,NA
"17","watch","Casio MQ24 Series","San Francisco Bagger","Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2024","Great Men/Women's Watch - thick-armed/wristed individuals beware though!","Nifty little plastic watch. Extremely light on the wrist; you hardly know it's there. No date feature, no luminous hands, just yer basic watch. Keeps perfect time. The description mentions a mineral glass crystal...nope. It's plastic, too.At 15 bucks what's not to like?",5,NA
"18","watch","Casio MQ24 Series","ameliapond","Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2024","","The watch itself is nice,  especially for low price. The band is more like a semi stiff plastic. I thought it was going to be soft like silicone bands. The little strap you tuck the excess band into pinched my arm once,  and to have the band tight enough to not keep shifting watch around my wrist isn't comfortable. I  ordered a few elastic replacement bands. I got the wrong size because it listed the width of band as 20mm. But the size you need to make it fit is 16mm. The band pins on this casio's band connectionis kind of hard to open. I used a paper clip to push the spring pin in (hard to get it to go) , and pull the band off at same time. The pin things on this are just straight.  Others I've used, including the replacement/ replacement bands I'm using have a kind of knobby thing attached that you can use to push in the spring activated pin. Much simpler. The elastic replacement band looks better than original and is way more comfortable.So, to sum up... watch itself if is great. It did come with battery already operating,  so I hope battery lasts a while, but no biggie.  While the actual watch is easy to read and the perfect size, the band that included is not great. A replacement elastic band (with 16mm size connection) makes the watch a 5/5. If it had been more expensive I would've been annoyed at having to get hew bands. But it's cheap and with new band it doesn't look cheap. So far its keeping time accurately. I also like that it's water resistant. The only negative I've found is the sub-par band, but new one can be gotten really cheap.Nice basic analog watch with a second hand, at a low price.",4,NA

I`m a retired senior with alot of health issues right now and I don`t have alot of money to pay for a new watch after paying all my health bills. I`m one human being who doesn`t like purchasing batteries when my watch stops working because alot of times I need to also replace the band so I rather like to purchase a new watch. The price of this watch fit into my budget very nicely so I was able to purchase two of them to switch off.",4,NA
