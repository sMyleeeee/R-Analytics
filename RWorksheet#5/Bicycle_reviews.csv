My daughter has an easy time riding with the training wheels. The 1 star off is for missing parts. We were missing a screw, but we were able to find something similar. The instructions also were for a different version of the bike, but we were able to figure it out.",5,NA

The instructions are minimal but sufficient, and the parts are pretty self-explanatory.We got the 14"" frame for our average-tall 3yo daughter and she has loved it.  She has ridden it 5-10 times so far (it's winter so limited opportunity).  She loves the pink and purple with flowers and a basket, which may seem trivial, but is key to getting a 3yo excited to ride a bike.We haven't shortened the training wheels yet and she is still figuring out how to use the coaster brakes, but the bike seems sturdy and, so far, well worth the money.",5,NA

"16","Bicycle","HILAND 26 27.5 Inch Mountain Bike","Customer Review","Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","This bike arrived well protected and had absolutely no shipping damage, which is impressive. Assembly was pretty straightforward, although the instructions provided no guidance as to how to get the front wheel past the brakes when installing it.  I removed one brake pad and then reinstalled it after passing the wheel through the brakes.  Everything else was a breeze, and everything fit together perfectly, with no missing or broken pieces.This bike is SOLID.  I am very impressed with the quality for this price.  The paint finish looks really nice.  The shifters are smooth and easy to operate.  The brakes do not require a lot of force to bring the bike to a quick stop.  I was not sure what to expect from this brand I had not heard of, but this really is a great bike.",5,NA
"17","Bicycle","HILAND 26 27.5 Inch Mountain Bike","Tuam Lis","Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2024","","This is a really good bike. Smooth rolling and brakes good. It may not have top tier parts but it gets me from point A to B without issues. The tires are decent in wet condition with no issues on slipping. The frame is steel and no replaceable derailleur hanger. Overall, the front forks help absorb some bump for a smoother ride and shift gears good.",4,NA
"18","Bicycle","HILAND 26 27.5 Inch Mountain Bike","jph55","Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2024","Really great mountain bike","Exploring trails has become a thrilling adventure with this sturdy mountain bike. The multiple speed options make tackling various terrains smooth and efficient. Its robust steel frame withstands rugged paths while providing a comfortable ride. The brakes respond promptly, enhancing safety during descents. Assembly was straightforward, and it's been a reliable companion on both casual rides and challenging excursions.",5,NA
"19","Bicycle","HILAND 26 27.5 Inch Mountain Bike","Essential Sailing Industries","Reviewed in the United States on October 30, 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars","The frame is surprisingly light for steel and it looks well constructed. It came more assembled than I excepted, easy to finish the assembly and get the rideable.  It's sort of a mountain bile but really a decent town cruiser.  It has cheap tires and could benefit by nicer tires, they are rated for 198lbs and 40 psi. The brakes work fine and were easy to adjust. I like the feel of it on the road.  I am using it as a fun little shop cruiser to run errands.",5,NA
"20","Bicycle","HILAND 26 27.5 Inch Mountain Bike","Essential Sailing Industries","Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2024","","The reason this doesn't get 5 stars is because the gear selectors have low quality printing on them. I feel my way through the gears based on the resistance, so this is not a deal breaker, but detracts from the overall quality of the bike.The packaging is excellent, there is no movement of any of the parts, so no scratched paint.  It contains the tools and parts necessary for assembly and the assembly is straight forward.  They have included the nuts on the cross bar to add a water bottle or pump.Overall, it is easy to assemble and rides fairly well, but I believe the price is a bit high for the quality issues mentioned, so look for a good sale.",5,NA

The 16‚Äù appears to be a good fit for her, she‚Äôs 6 years old on the small side, she‚Äôs 3‚Äô8. My only dig is that the bell was missing. Its enough to dock them a star in my mind, the box came to the house and it had been opened. Probably not their fault, maybe it fell out, maybe someone took it, who knows, daughter doesn‚Äôt even know it came with one but I‚Äôll end up picking one up somewhere for her.

"31","Bicycle","JOYSTAR Angel Girls Bike for Toddlers and Kids Ages 2-13 Years Old","Krishna","Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2024","","I am going to admit that I bought this for my granddaughter because of the way it looked.  I also read reviews and they were excellent.  And the manufacturer of the bike makes many different bikes, all with good reviews.  It was easy to assemble, except for adjusting the hand brake, and when assembled, it knocks your socks off.  The only other minor qualm I have about the bike is that even at their highest setting, the included training wheels are not high enough.  Our granddaughter is a very girly young lady and I'm sure she is going to love it when we give it to her on her birthday.  The included basket is perfect for her to take one of her dolls for a ride.",1,NA

"41","Bicycle","Hiland 20 Inch Kids Mountain Bike for Boys","George C","Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2020","QUALITY/CONDITION/CONTENT","This is the first ""Bike-in-a-Box"" that I have ever purchased (Hiland Redeem in Green). All of my bikes have always been purchased from a brick-and-mortar store. Due to COVID, this was my only choice to get my son his present. The item arrived with a hole in side of the box, and the front axle was poking out. Luckily, nothing was damaged. Everything else looked to be intact, and of course there were no instructions. Being the bike mechanic for all the kids in the neighborhood, I didn't need the directions. I agree with all of the other reviewers that this bike needs to be assembled and tuned up from top to bottom.Here is what I experienced: Some parts (stem, wheels, chain) were very tight; the crank was unusually loose and later discovered during a test ride. The stem was so tight, it would not rotate. This had to be fixed before the handlebars were mounted. It was loosened, adjusted, and realigned. Then the handlebars were mounted. While adjusting the cable for the front brakes, the cable loop (which is simply spot welded) broke off. This was easily fixed with a cable tie. Front and rear axles needed to be loosened a bit to rotate freely. I also checked to make sure they were greased (luckily they were). The rear wheel was adjusted so tight, that the chain would most likely snap. I loosen the steel nut on the adjusting bolt (near the cassette) to give the chain a small amount of play. The rear axle pegs were then tightened, and the chain tension rechecked. The rear brake cable was adjusted so that it fed into the clamp from the outside. This allowed for proper clearance between the bare cable and the seat tube. During the test ride, the crank nut loosened to where I was able to spin it with my fingers. The chain wheel was also wobbling. I removed the crank nut completely to get access to the fasteners by the chain wheel. Once every nut on the crank was tightened back up, I rode the bike again. This bike rides fine, and is not too heavy (about 30 lbs.).  The brakes work fine, but the pads are terrible. If I plan to relive my ""Rad"" (the Hal Needham movie) days, I will have to swap the pads for some Kool Stops. I am giving this item four stars because it is essentially a China knock-off of the Mongoose Legion, but it does the job. The price (costs more than a Mongoose!?) is only inflated because of COVID.",4,NA
"42","Bicycle","Hiland 20 Inch Kids Mountain Bike for Boys","George C","Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","This bike was poorly made. I purchased the first time and after putting together realized both wheels (not tires) were warped. This made it impossible to ride because 1) the bike would wobble and 2) the brakes would rub on half the wheel and then not touch when braking on the other half of the wheel.I returned the bike and requested a replacement. The replacement arrived within a week and the wheel problem was correct. I put the bike together and upon airing up the tires realized the back had a leak. I ordered an inner tube for it and replaced it. I pumped up the tire. Immediately the tire had a leak again. I compared the two leaking inner tubes and the leak was in the same place. I removed the tire from the wheel to inspect and discovered that several of the wheel spokes, which are attached to the inner side of the wheel (where the inner tube rests between the wheel and tire) were jagged and sharp, which was puncturing the tube when inflated.Extremely poor quality and unsafe for a child. You‚Äôre better off buying an $80 bike at Walmart.",4,NA

"46","Bicycle","Hiland 20 Inch Kids Mountain Bike for Boys","JF","Reviewed in Canada on October 17, 2024","","First and foremost, I should note that you need to know something about bike maintenance....well, actually....you need to know everything about bike maintenance if you're planning on buying this for your child and putting it together yourself. If you don't know how to maintain a bike, I suggest taking it to a bike store to getting it checked. Specifically (based on my experience putting two of these together now), at the very least you should look out for the following issues that I found on either both, or one or the other of the two bikes that I purchased for my kids:1. Brake cables not oiled (unexpected).2. Brake cables not properly adjusted (somewhat expected, but one was really, really off).3. Brake pad adjustments required after installing the front wheel (expected).4. Grease various parts (expected - handle bar joints, seat post. Unexpected - kickstand spring/mechanism).5. Check tightness of brake hand levers (expected, I guess).6. Fully deflate and reposition inner tube inside the tire (unexpected).7. Remove buckle from rear wheel!!! (Yikes - that was totally unexpected - see the video).8. Check every bolt on the bike to ensure reasonable tightness for the purpose (expected, I guess, and there was one loose bolt on the rear wheel, so please do check).9. Oil bike chain and inflate tires (totally expected).In essence, it seems that there is not a great deal of concern about the final stages of manufacturing of these bikes, i.e., the stage where they're basically putting all the parts together. Having said that, the bike design is quite good and suitable for normal bike riding (not for tricks, freestyle, racing, etc.). The manual that came with the bikes was not specific for this model, but was general for several of the models that they sell. It was well-written and generally easy to comprehend. The paintwork, tires, frame construction, and individual components (brake parts, pedals, kick stand, handlebar grips, seat cushion, paint on the rims) are all of good quality for the cost of the bike. I do have a concern about the quality of the rear wheel hub as I'm certain that they are running a little too noisy (suggesting a lack of grease or poor quality components - listen carefully to the lower-pitched, grinding sound in the video - that sound is coming from the wheel hub, not from something rubbing against the rim or tire). I suspect that they will last at least a couple of years so I'm not too concerned about that. It may be that they are meant to be noisy, although the noisy rear hub, combined with the buckle in one of the rear wheels (see video) just makes me wonder again about the final stage of manufacturing of these bikes. OK, overall, not a bad bike for the price, but be prepared to put in some effort to ensure a safe ride for your child or grandchild.Bike size advice: My kids are both nine years old and about 54"" and 52"" tall, and the bikes work well for both of them. I expect that they'll get about one to two years of use out of the bikes. So the 42"" - 56"" recommendation, and 5 - 9 year age group seems reasonable. However, I do think (but am not certain) that the average 5 year old would be a little too small to handle this bike size. For example, I feel that the handlebars would be sitting a little too high for a typical 5 year old, and I also feel that the brake levers would be a little too difficult for a 5 year old's hands to reach comfortably. Again, I stand corrected on this. Worst case scenario, if it is too small you can always store it for later use.  I think the perfect age for this bike would be a seven year old, average-size kid, and would end up getting about 3 years of good use out of it.",5,NA
