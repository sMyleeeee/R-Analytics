"1","GamingChair","AA Products Gaming Chair High Back Ergonomic Computer","Alex Desmarais","Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2019","","I was using the crappiest chair so this was a major upgrade. I have already taken one nap in it and slept well (the foot rest is amazing). I wish the bottom cushion was a bit more comfortable but I am being incredibly nitpicky. The chair also seems to be of solid construction so far. The only thing I think is a potential con is if you are not confident in building things because the chair came quite dis-assembled and took some time to put together (about an hour or so). If you are not comfortable with building things either go a different direction or be prepared to get some help. Otherwise I think great for the cost. I imagine other gaming chairs with the same quality and features are more around the $200 mark so this is great for someone who does not want to spend $400 on a chair but still wants features, comfort, and quality.",5,NA
"2","GamingChair","AA Products Gaming Chair High Back Ergonomic Computer","Dave","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2021","","It came quickly in the mail within four days. it only took us  30 minutes to assemble it and I didn’t even need the instructions - come on it’s a chair with only a few pieces to assemble lol and it was very easy to follow the directions if you needed to refer back. Of course I am kind of a handy guy with tools, but even if you have a little bit of experience you shouldn’t have a problem putting this chair together there’s really not that many pieces to assemble. I’ve seen people write some reviews saying that they took two hours to figure it out and that’s just ridiculous. It’s really comfortable and fun to use. It has a lot of options like recline, extra padding for lumbar support and neck support and it’s, fully adjustable, and very well-made, and most importantly priced fairly. I’ve seen chairs go for way more and this one is just as good.Im going to get another for office at my garage. It’s so sporty looking! I keep seeing people say this thing breaks? Well, I’m 220lbs and five feet eleven and I didn’t break the foot rest like these other people who must be slam dancing in the chair all night lol come on guys this is a 200 dollar middle of the road chair that’s giving you a lot of nice options and features, AND for a fair price! This isn’t a premium office chair you’ll find in a law firm, bank, or executives conference room, those chairs are usually 1000 dollars folks. I’m also buying the matching desk they make too right after I’m done posting this review. Because I’ve bought many office chairs over the years and I’m having the most fun with this one. And yes, this chair is best fitted for certain “frame types” let’s say, but I’m no small guy and I take care of my stuff that I buy and I’m not rough with it. It’s great for gaming for a few hours and  he’ll yeah as well as kicking back the recline feature and talking on the phone lol I’m so buying another chair for my office at the garage and a desk too! I wanna look cool over there and this chair screams racing!  I don’t care if it lasts only a few years, or maybe it will be last more since I take good care of things,  I’m not using it to go on a ship into outer space with the dam thing! I don’t need a five hundred dollar elite brand chair for my every day work. A buddy of mine has the same chair in his garage with a rough edged floor, grease, and chemicals and he’s had his chair a whole year beating on it and it never broke, I don’t know what these people are doing with the chair but they can’t be treating them correctly. So pound for pound and option for option, this was the best deal going. And anyone who says this chair is less then four stars surely doesn’t know what there talking about. I sat on this chair six hours today and the padding and pillows were satisfactory. Of course my leg was a bit sore because heck, nobody should sit for that long on any chair!lol  But for the money, and the design, I think this chair is just fine.",5,NA

It is surprisingly comfortable when reclining. The neck support helps. First time I used it, I didn’t realize I was playing for hours and hours. It is easy to move around. It was a little difficult to assemble-just some parts were bulky and definitely needed two helpers! The foot rest that slides out is ok, it feels a little flimsy to me. Could be sturdier.

"5","GamingChair","AA Products Gaming Chair High Back Ergonomic Computer","Doris","Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2024","","A disaster of a transaction all around and I strongly urge anyone paying attention not to buy this.The building process is awful, screws don't easily go into holes, instructions aren't clear, etc. It took me 5-6 hours to get it built and this is the 4th chair like this I've had so I like to think I know what I am doing.Once built, the 2 most important parts didn't work. The lever for the back of the chair did nothing, thus the back stood straight up with zero give to lean back. Also, the gas canister under the seat part did not work so there as no ability to raise/lower the seat.I took out a 2-year warranty/protection plan thankfully. HOWEVER, ran into more issues with that. The company claimed they sent it, was scheduled for delivery on Feb. 6 arriving independently from the chair. This got delayed until Feb. 8. Then Feb. 9. Finally on Feb. 13 I checked and the tracking number indicated it might be lost.Amazon contacted the company to open a case and have the respond/get me out a new protection plan/paperwork but instead of discussing and doing this the VERY QUICKLY canceled my 2-year protection plan and issued a refund without even consulting me.So, for a brief while, I had a defective chair that did not work at all and no protection plan to apply for a refund.Thankfully, Amazon took care of it and refunded me everything but urged me to write this.I suspect this company is a scam. The price of the chair is so low for a reason. Cause it's a bad product that doesn't work well. The company knows this, they know most won't take out a warranty for such a cheap item. I did, which had them worried so they quickly canceled/refunded it once they knew I had an issue with the chair and would want to use this warranty for a refund.BUYER BEWARE",5,NA

"17","GamingChair","GTRACING Gaming Chair with Footrest, Ergonomic Computer","Prewar Mangold","Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2024","Love it so far","This chair is seriously comfy. The ergonomic design is on point, and the footrest is a game-changer (pun intended). Whether you're gaming or working, you'll appreciate the support it provides.The reclining feature is also a nice touch. Being able to adjust the angle is great for preventing stiffness during long sessions. And the swivel and rocker functions? Super convenient.Now, onto durability. While the chair feels solid overall, there are a few areas that could be improved. Some users have reported issues with the armrests feeling a bit wobbly, and the fabric can be prone to wear and tear over time.And let's talk about that navy blue color. It's stylish, sure, but it might not be to everyone's taste. Personally, I love it, but I can see how some people might prefer something a bit more neutral.Overall, I'd give the GTRACING Footrest, Ergonomic Computer Game Desk, Reclining Gamer Chair a solid 4 out of 5 stars. It's comfy, supportive, and built to last, but it's not without its minor flaws. If you're in the market for a gaming chair, it's definitely worth considering.",4,NA

The chair functioned perdectly after assembly, and I have to say this chair is certainly worth the money.On pure aesthetics, this chair is a 10! The lumbar support is perfect and easy to adjust (you just slide ot up/down to where you need it. The adjustabke height on the arm rests has a large range, and easily adjusta low enough to get under my desk. The heavy duty weight rating is perfect for a 250lb guy.The only problem i have is the comfort. For a young man or a light-weight person it will be fine, but the seat just isnt made for a heavy older man who sits behind a desk for 12 hours a day. My rear end gets sore after a couple of hours and i have to use a cushion on the seat for some relief.",3,NA

I do wish the armrests were a bit more controlled and that the pullout foot lounger seems cheap and hard to move around.Overall a great chair that can last.

"26","GamingChair","Gaming Chair, Gaming Chairs for Adults with Footrest","Nirmal","Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2024","","A friend of mine has an $800 gaming chair which is really cool and super comfortable. This chair looked similar and was only $150 so I decided to give it a try. Is it as good as that $800 gaming chair? No. Definitely not. But it's still a comfortable chair that I like more than the chair I was using.I like the material. It's soft and feels good on my bare skin. I had to put armrest covers on my other chair because the hard plastic would irritate my forearms. No need for those on this chair. The seat, back, arms, and headrest are all covered with this material, whatever it is, and padded with a dense foam underneath. The lumbar pad offers nice back support and the headrest is quite comforting. I also like that the main support post is higher off the ground than any of my other office chairs by a couple inches.The back reclines and locks in place at whichever angle you desire, which is really cool. Unfortunately, it reclines too easily for me. There isn't enough resistance. I think that's my one major gripe, but even that's not too bad. I locked it in at a certain angle and have been okay with that. Still, I wish they would have made the resistance adjustable like all my other office chairs.So I guess I should get into some of the downsides, all of which are pretty minor. The armrest height is not adjustable. For me, that's fine as they're already at the perfect height. It comes with a leg rest thing which I found to be uncomfortable. The edge of it hits my legs at just the wrong place. I've never used one of these before and not even sure why I would want to. The lumbar pillow just sits on the seat, it doesn't connect in any way. In my friend's $800 chair this and the headrest both connect via magnets. The headrest on this attaches via elastic band.For $150 this is a very nice chair. It's no $800 chair but it looks nice and is comfortable on the butt, back, arms, and head.",5,NA

"30","GamingChair","Gaming Chair, Gaming Chairs for Adults with Footrest","Travis W","Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2024","Great chair if you're on a budget","Ordered this chair to replace an aging Branch ergonomic chair. The product was received well packaged protecting good quality components. It took me about 30 minutes to assemble using the simple 1 page directions and included hex/Phillips combi tool.The color is a little darker than shown on the product page - more of a bluish slate color that should go well with most decors (see photo). Initial impressions are that the seat is pretty firm, which differs from the product description (""super soft and wide cushion""). I'm hoping it will soften with more use. The seat bottom and back are wide, easily accommodating my 6'1"" 240LB frame.The upholstery is described as a fabric having excellent breathability. It feels like PU leather to me rather than a fabric. I'm hoping the material is breathable when we get back into the warmer Southern California weather. It IS soft and comfortable, and is also used for the seat pillow, lumbar cushion and footrest.Speaking of the footrest, not sure what the function is. It slides directly out of the seat bottom. which is no where near my feet. Perhaps gamers might use it depending on how they sit in the chair but the position would be beyond my old dad body.Summarizing, the chair is sturdy and made from good quality materials. It is easy to assemble and feels solid when completed. It is roomy, and has adjustments for seat height and seat back recline. The seat bottom is firm when received. Combined with the testing noted in the product description I should get years of service.",5,NA

"38","GamingChair","GTRACING Gaming Chair with Footrest Speakers Video Game","Hyperion","Reviewed in the United States on April 1, 2022","","I purchased this to set up my new office. After combing through the vast selection of other chairs and all the reviews, I decided on this chair and I could not be happier.Before I launch into my assessment of the chair, I just want to say that you should absolutely buy it if you are thinking about purchasing this particular one. I have had many desk chairs of varying prices, sizes, features, etc. and this chair has thoroughly impressed me.Let's start with the assembly, which was so easy and straightforward. I saw some complaints about having a hard time with setting it up, but honestly, just use your brain and all will be ok. I am sure many could set this up without the instructions, which I did until I got to setting up the built-in speakers.I sit in this chair daily for hours and it is SO comfortable. Being able to adjust the back to several different angles is fantastic. The head and lumbar pillows are also great at giving some added support; they never feel like they're in the way. Reclining the chair to its furthest extent offers a very comfortable resting position, and, along with the added foot rest, it truly is a remarkably comfy ""recliner"" chair. The armrests are adjustable and offer some rotation so you can find the sweet spot for yourself.The built-in speakers are nifty too. **Disclaimer: You must buy the Bluetooth USB Receiver to utilize this feature.** I wasn't expecting much from them, but I do find myself switching to use them for certain entertainment purposes like listening to background music while I work or when I am playing specific games, in particular horror or racing games. The sound is way better than I anticipated, though they do lack bass. The relay unit lasts for hours (days usually for me) and charges quickly enough to never create frustration.Some other notes:-I saw a few complaints about the packaging and indentations created from remaining bundled up in the box. However, I did not experience this at all. All of the cushioned pieces came out of the box well packaged and without blemishes of any kind.-There was an odor initially when taking it out of the box. Ya know, that warehouse smell. After an hour or so, the smell had completely dissipated.-In regards to the Top Critical Review for this chair; That customer is absolutely insane and I cannot fathom what they were expecting for a chair in this price range. I used to have a fancy $980 chair provided from my employer, the largest social media entity. Comparatively, I am far happier with this chair. Yes, there are some plastic parts (dust covers, gas lift cover, armrests) but the expensive chair had the same plastic components. I feel less tension in my lower back after spending 6+ hours in this chair vs the expensive one where I would find myself getting up to walk around every so often to relieve the pain in my lower back. Oh, and they had mentioned missing parts due to the box being damaged (which has no bearing on the product itself); those particular items cannot be lost as they are attached to the chair and in a special pouch located on the back of the chair (see photo). They obviously didn't realize that.All-in-all, this is an excellent purchase for anyone who is looking at a new desk chair. The price is phenomenal for the quality and the amount of features. There is also a good amount of colors to choose from so you can better match your style and decor.",5,NA
"39","GamingChair","GTRACING Gaming Chair with Footrest Speakers Video Game","Hyperion","Reviewed in the United States on May 12, 2022","","I’ve watched a lot of YT videos of this chair but was hesitant to order online but for $160 how bad could it be?Similar style chairs in Office Max start around $300 but with bonded leather which is commonly known to peel and tear over time.This is PU leather which is not as breathable but sturdy like vinyl without cracking or peeling.First off, assembly is extremely straight forward with incredible step by step instructions.  Hats off to whoever put it together.The seat is surprisingly comfortable and sturdy, as the YT reviews suggested but much more comfortable than I would’ve expected.  I needed a more firm and supportive chair so don’t expect to sink in and be plushy.Every video BASHED the speaker quality comparing it to laptop equivalence. I had low expectations and thought it was more of a gimmick but these are actually louder and having more bass than what YT videos would have you think.  Don’t expect full Bose type quality but for the size of the speakers I would compare it to a smaller JBL flip. These speakers DO NOT distort at high volumes or deep bass (my music of choice is EDM)My only complaint is the foot rest, I wouldn’t pay the money for it.  I’m 5”10 with slightly longer legs than normal and the footrest is more of a calf rest.  My feet hang off and I wish it could come out a few more inches.  The foot rest is not that sturdy and has some give. It’s not well crafted and not really worth using by if you’re under 5’10 than this May suit you well.All in all, exceptional quality, easy to assemble and I would definitely look into this as a really good alternative to the Respawn 110",5,NA

The back cushion support and headrest are a plus.  Reclines really far back which is also nice. If you have the time, the chair is worth it.",5,NA
"52","GamingChair","OneGame Gaming Chair","Mills","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024","","This gaming chair combines comfort and style with its striking black and pink design. The ergonomic headrest and lumbar support cushions provide excellent comfort during long sessions, while the sturdy build ensures durability. The adjustable armrests and sleek design make it a great choice for both gaming and working.",5,NA
"53","GamingChair","OneGame Gaming Chair","Mills","Reviewed in the United States on March 23, 2024","This is the best gaming chair","I've been remiss in leaving reviews for all the many things I've purchased from Amazon but this one has frustrated/displeased me enough to break that trend. I'm 220 lbs and 6'0"". I'm 66 yrs. old and have sat in hundreds of chairs like this one over the years. I've assembled them, used them for ages, and thrown them away after I've worn them out. If you're a short person you'll not have an issue with this chair. By short I mean no more than 5' probably. I set this chair to be at it's highest height as that's what is most comfortable for me. Unfortunately, as the day goes by it slowly sinks to the bottom height and I find my knees eventually crushing my chest. Now that's a slight exaggeration but you get the point.Yes, I know how to ""lock"" the mechanism. Every day, I use the handle to again lift the chair to its max height for the day's use, and then slowly but surely as time drags on it sinks to the bottom and becomes extremely uncomfortable and, essentially, unusable.I'd return it but the excessive difficulty putting it together, even with two people, makes the thought of disassembling it horrendous. And then to load it into a vehicle and actually wait in line somewhere to drop it off for return makes the process impossible.When it's at its best and standing tall this chair is extremely good, but give it an hour or so and it begins to become what, to me, is a very vociferous ""DO NOT BUY"" recommendation.One other minor irritation but a consistent one nonetheless are the arms. There is a rather large gap between the back of the arm and the back of the chair. If you wear shortsleeve shirts, and that's mandatory for me here in Florida, when you go to stand up your sleeve has a frequent tendency to get caught on the end of the arm causing some humorous gesticulations. A design flaw for me personally but probably won't be much of an issue for others.",5,NA
"54","GamingChair","OneGame Gaming Chair","Amazon Customer","Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2024","","The chair is easy to assemble, it rolls pretty smoothly. The pillows make the chair much more comfortable. The chair is more slim looking than my 400 dollar gaming chair, but for this price, it is great looking and functional.",4,NA
"55","GamingChair","OneGame Gaming Chair","Qiyong Zhang","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024","","The chair is very comfortable. It is very easy to assemble. It also looks good. I like the function that it can lower the back all the way down and I can lay on it. I would recommend others to buy it.",5,NA
"56","GamingChair","OneGame Gaming Chair","Qiyong Zhang","Reviewed in Canada on June 23, 2024","So comfy","I've tested 3 Ergonomic Office Chairs, 5 Gaming Chairs and to be honest, this one is the best for under $300. I tested out a Stples chair of the same quality at $470.00 with taxes and I'm glad I bought this one.No, I am not getting paid to say this. I love this chair and I see a few negative reviews here, so I'd love to share my thoughts.PROS:- the lumbar support and pillow are great. It's not too hard, not too soft.- pillows are adjustable. If you really don't like them, 1. Remove them and 2. Buy a memory foam velcro pillow that clips on, for a car. It's the same thing and twice as comfortable, for only $30-50 each. Smart savings.- the construction feels great and the material is virtually the same of other gaming chairs rated at $400-600 range. If you want a perfect gaming chair, be prepared to spend $700-900. It may be a lot, sure, but think of how long you're gonna own a chair, and think of the back pain it'll save you from. I had a small blue chair with no support from age 13-28, so it's time to upgrade.- If your chair breaks in some way, there is limited warranty from the supplier and amazon. But keep in mind, a chair for only $150.00, is a risk you take. That's super cheap for what you get.- the chair reclines almost at a full 180 degrees (approximately 170), allowing you to lay flat. I love it.- armests are adjustable, up and down only, not side to side or left to right.- I have sat in the chair for 6 hours, doing homework and gaming and I love it. I am 6' 0"" at 185lbs. The chair is good for me but if you are over 215lbs, you may want a slightly wider chair.CONS:- armests are only 2D, not 4D. This is expected for the price.- no footrest, but that doesn't matter. I've tried the footrests for a lot of these chairs and they suck. 1. They're not long enough, so your feet hang, as the footrest ends, 6"" before your heel, 2. They're not well made. 3. What I did instead was buy a $130.00 ottoman with storage, non-foldable, on Amazon, and it's a perfect footrest which I can move around freely. I use the storage for my gaming controllers and the ottoman fits perfectly under my desk if I want more space. In case I can't post a link in a review, here's the product info. Name: ""Tufted Leather Square Flip Top Storage Ottoman Cube Foot Rest, Black"" sold by ""H&B Luxuries"" on Amazon.- a review I saw ""oh the plastic piece of the side broke."" Not sure how, as this is fastened via 1 screw. If your screw hole is too big, add 1 small washer and this will fix the problem. Mine was fine. 1. Test out any product you get and 2. If there are any issues, it's your job to return them and get a new one or a refund. Accidents do happen in manufacturing, but instead, I see people complain, and write a bad review LOL. That's your fault brother.- it'd be nice if this chair came in more colours, but I love the black as it blends with everything. White & black usually do. I got an all black chair myself.",5,NA
