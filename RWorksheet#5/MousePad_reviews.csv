Pretty simple mouse pad and durable. I really like the size as I tend to not like small regular size ones. This allows me to have more freedom with the mouse without running off the pad.  I do music and larger pads are needed so I can adjust multiple parameters and knobs in my digital audio workstation.  PERFECT MOUSE PAD for music creators!  Highly recommended.  Thank you Amazon Basics! :)",5,NA

"10","MousePad","Amazon Basics Square Mouse Pad, Cloth with Rubberized Base, Standard, Black","Juan Armando","Reviewed in Mexico on April 3, 2022","","Material pesado, con goma en la parte de abajo, por lo que no se desliza, y además no pierde la forma plana. 100% recomendado. Ojo con el tamaño, puede ser demasiado grande para escritorios estándar y uno tendría que poner el monitor de la computadora encima del pad, pero si se tiene en cuenta esto, es un muy buen producto. Tengo con él apenas unos 6 meses pero se nota que va a durar mucho tiempo; muy buenos materiales. Es grande y pesado por lo que no es portátil como para llevarlo a todos lados, pero cumple al 100 en lugares de trabajo fijos",5,NA

"14","MousePad","MROCO Ergonomic Mouse Pad with Gel Wrist Rest","Deyzha","Reviewed in the United States on August 30, 2024","","I have never been a mousepad person, but I had to order one because my mouse would not glide properly on my desk. I recently put contact paper on my desk to liven it up a bit, but realized my mouse would NOT glide properly on it. I found this mousepad and I appreciated the look, support, and price. When it arrived, I didn’t notice a strong smell at all; it smells like what I imagine a mousepad is to smell like haha. I really like the ergonomic support, the size, and the softness of the pad, and it works really well for my mouse! One of the main reasons why I don’t like many mousepads is the backing. This one has an excellent grip; it’s almost like it’s glued down to my desk, so there is no slipping, just be sure to remove the protective plastic on the back.",5,NA
"15","MousePad","MROCO Ergonomic Mouse Pad with Gel Wrist Rest","Deyzha","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024","","This thing is made nice. The anti slip grip underneath is damn near glue but in a good way. It’s nice and wide, feels comfortable but not too soft. Not sure why you would need anything else if this is the style you’re looking for.",5,NA

I looked for one similar to my current mouse pad. Then I saw some recommended like this. I thought they looked ridiculous and nowhere near as comfortable as others.I ordered it. When it arrived, I was surprised the colors/image matched the photos on the website. I put it into use that day, and pleasantly discovered it was way more comfortable than the ones with just a wrist bump.",5,NA

"30","MousePad","Hokafenle Ergonomic Mouse Pad Wrist Support with Stepped-Wedge Design","Katherine A Didier","Reviewed in the United States on April 4, 2024","It looks silly, but","I've got an odd set-up where I work, sitting on an accent chair in front of my media stand (computer's hooked up to my tv). Because I am sitting considerably lower than most desk chair/desk situations, I needed something to take the pressure off the heal of my hand, which gets really sore after a day of writing. This thing has ample padding for that... and the difference in densities due to the slope makes it really versitile when I need to adjust into a different position. Can't wait to try it out in a ""normal"" setting, but it looks like the high point will comfortably hit the small of my wrist.Also, aesthetically, it looks great with the Logitech Lift ergonomic mouse. And it's non-skid!",5,NA

"32","MousePad","Hokafenle Ergonomic Mouse Pad Wrist Support with Stepped-Wedge Design","Jake P","Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2024","","Love these designs too, but overall it's just better than the ones I've used so for that all want to hold the wrist up at a bend. It's larger than I expected but in a good wayI want to get a couple for work it's honestly that much better of the wrist rest design. Great quality and not hard or too spongy, it's what you'd want without the worry of a gel popping and mishaping ruining the whole thing. I prefer this type for sure.",5,NA
